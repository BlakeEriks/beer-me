[Goal Feed](https://goal-feed-bb3b9crdv-blakeeriks.vercel.app/) is a web app that let's you check highlights on recent professional soccer (football) matches that you didn't get to watch.

Goal Feed is built using HTML5, CSS4, Javascript and JQuery 3.3.1

### Approach

This app uses a single API call to get a list of recent matches from [ScoreBat](https://www.scorebat.com). This list is then filtered based on what the user enters into the search field.

### Future Enhancements:

* API provides multiple video links sometimes - create sliding panel for these instances

* Highlighting on currently hovered match / show more button

* Animate added matches after clicking show more

* Remove show more button when end of list is reached.
